# YogaClan_project1


This project was completed during week five of the sixteen-week course at CodeClan.

## Brief:
You want an app that allows you to custom build your yoga sequences, which are made up of individual poses. 
Each pose will have an image, a recommended ‘hold time’, an exertion level (1 to 10) and a brief description.

## Minimal Viable Product:
Create poses
Create sequences (of multiple poses)
Show a page listing all poses and sequences

## Possible Extensions:
‘Play’ the sequence, showing each image in the sequence for the recommended ‘hold time’
Create a sequence of random poses, based upon your choice of time OR exertion level
